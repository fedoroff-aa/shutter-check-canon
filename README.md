Here you can see a tutorial how you can check shutter count and history of happend errors on Canon cameras. You can do it quickly with my guide for free or pay capitalists if you have much money and think it's okay to pay to check your camera's state. It's useful for people who buy or sell used Canon cameras.

## Prerequisites
