# English version
Here you can see a tutorial how you can check shutter count and history of happend errors on Canon cameras. You can do it quickly with my guide for free or pay capitalists if you have much money and think it's okay to pay to check your camera's state. It's useful for people who buy or sell used Canon cameras.

## Prerequisites
Suitable models for check using such a way are all Canon EOS R-series mirrorless cameras (maybe it works for DSLR cameras too, I haven't tried it yet).
Or to be more accurate here is a list:
- Canon EOS R,
- Canon EOS Ra,
- Canon EOS RP,
- Canon EOS R3,
- Canon EOS R5,
- Canon EOS R5 C,
- Canon EOS R6,
- Canon EOS R6 Mark II,
- Canon EOS R8,
- Canon EOS R7,
- Canon EOS R10

## Preparing
1. Find or buy ~~or steal~~ SDHC Card (SDXC is not suitable), whose capacity is equal to or lower than 32 GB.
2. Prepare your SD Card using [this tutorial](https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/EOScard#[_http://pel.hu/down/EOScard.exe_]).
3. Download [extend.m](https://github.com/fedoroff-aa/shutter-check-canon/blob/main/extend.m) and [script.req](https://github.com/fedoroff-aa/shutter-check-canon/blob/main/script.req) to your PC and copy them to the root of prepared SD Card.
